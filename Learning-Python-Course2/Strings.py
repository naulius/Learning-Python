# Strings area sequence of characters or words which are written in single or double quotes.
# Example :
"Hola"
'No'

# String are in an ordered sequence.We can use indexing and slicing.
# Indexing: Use brackets [].Take a portion or character in an index position.
# Example:
# Characters :    h  e  l  l   o
# Index :         0  1  2  3   4
# Reverse Index:  0 -4 -3 -2  -1

# Slicing: Use brackets [].Take a slice/part/multiple characters of the string.
# The syntax is: [start,stop,step]
# Start is the numerical index for the slice start.
# Stop is the index that you want to take but not included.
# Step is the size of the jump you take.
# Spaces count as characters in the string.
# Try not to mix characters in the same string, it can confuse Python.
# Use backslash and n when you want to write in other cell.
# Example:
print("Hola \namigos todos")

# You can also check the length of a string
# Example:
print(len("Hola amigos")) # It has 11 letters, it counts spaces.
