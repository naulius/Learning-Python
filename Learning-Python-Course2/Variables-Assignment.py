# A variable is a data type with a name and value. A variable name can not be a number. It has to be a word or few words
# For example:
# my_dog = ["Joe", "Moma]. This is a list that has variable name,it can be changed at least in Python but not in other
# program language.
# with no space, instead we use the underscore symbol _.
# We can not use other symbols but underscore.
# It's recommended not to use special names use in Python like str,etc. Also is better to use lower case.
# Example of variables:

a = 5
print(a+a)
print(type(a)) # We can check the type of variable that we have, writing type and the name of the variable.
# In this example the type of variable is an integer/int number.

a = 3.5
print(type(a)) # In this example the variable type is a float number.

my_income = 100
tax_rate = 0.1
my_taxes = my_income * tax_rate
print(my_taxes)
