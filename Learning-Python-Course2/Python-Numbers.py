# We can use python as a calculator, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
# For Addition use  + sign.
# For Subtraction use - sign.
# For Multiplication use asterisk * sign.
# For Division use slash / sign.
# Square root: We use double asterisks **.
# Examples:
print(4+2)
print(7-5)
print(5*6)
print(10/4)

# We can also calculate the remainder of a division, for what we use the mod sign %.
# Example:
print(7/4)
print(7%4) # The remainder is 3, el primer residuo de la operacion.
print(50%5) # The remainder is 0
# Use this operation when you want to check if a number is divisible, if it's even or odd.
# Example:
print(23%2) # We see that the remainder is 1 so 23 is an odd number.
print(20%2) # In this operation the remainder is 0, so we know 20 is an even number.

# Example for the square root:
print(2**3)

# You can also have multiple types of mathematical operations.
# Example:
print(2+10*10+3) # In this operation is going to do first the multiplication then the addition.
# If you want that an operation comes first, use parenthesis.
# Example:
print ((2+10) * (10+3)) # In this case use double parenthesis.

# Exercise of the course: Write an expression that equals 100\
# Solution: (25+25) * 2
# Additional Exercises:
print(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3)
print(1/2)
